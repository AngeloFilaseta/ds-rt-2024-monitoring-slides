    Narrativa:
    INTRO
    - Simulazioni come strumento di testing, perch√©? 
    - Multiple simulazioni, vengono poi aggregate per ottenre un risultato
    - Problemi, ci vuole un fracco di tempo (mostra processo)
    OBJECTIVEczlc
    - Creare un architettura che permette di visionare aspetti di simulazioni a run time
    HOW TO DO THIS?
    - Monitorare simulazione distributie non √® troppo diverso da monitorare un DS classico ma...
    - ci servono le seguenti cose - poter ottenere feedback realtime,
        che i messaggi siano piccoli, poter cambiare cosa osservare velocemente,
        poter monitorare pi√π simulazioni e aggregare i dati
    - filter what to monitor
    ARCHITECTURE
    - Elements
    - How they interact
    - Aggregation... lot of methods in literature
    Prototype
    - Alchemist and GraphQL

# Simulations as Testing Tools

- Simulations allow to **validate** theories by comparing outcomes with expected or real-world behavior;
- Usually, **multiple simulations** are run *in parallel* to obtain a statistically significant result;
- Simulations can also be *distributed* across multiple nodes to speed up the process even further;
  - The results are usually **aggregated** using statistical methods (mean, median, etc.);

- In reality, this process is both **time consuming** and **resource intensive** <small>(and also quite tedious)</small>
- Even under the most favorable conditions,
the time needed to unify the results *is constrained by the slowest execution* among the runs.

- Moreover, we are not accounting for the potential occurrence of **anomalies**, which could not only prolong the time required for the process
  - but may also necessitate starting over entirely! <small>(üò≠)</small>

- What we want are **early feedback** about the behavior of the system under development;
  - The system will still be validated using the traditional way, but *a lot of time can be saved* in the long run!<small>(ü§©)</small>

## Distributed Simulations of Distributed Systems

- An **efficient** and **scalable** method for monitoring *multiple* distributed simulations in real-time is required;

{{< figure src="trans.svg" >}}

- Monitoring *distributed simulations* is more complex than monitoring *traditional distributed systems*;

- The parameters to track may not be predefined or known in advance.
  - General-purpose simulators are even more challenging, since parameters may change frequently.

# Architecture

{{% multicol %}}
{{% col class="col-7" %}}
### Key Components
-  **Target Distributed System (TDS)**:<br> the simulated element in which properties of interest are located;

-  **Network Node**:<br> the logical device hosting and executing TDSs;

-  **Broker**:<br> provides an interface to interact with a TDS;
    - a Broker interacts with only one TDS;
    - three types of interactions: _Query_, _Action_, and **Subscription**;
   
- **Monitor**:<br> interacts with multiple Brokers in order to retrieve data from the TDSs.

# Challenges

This work advances the current state of the art addressing some open challenges in *parallel and distributed simulation*, as classified by Fujimoto [1]:

- **"Online decision-making using real-time distributed simulation‚Äù**:<br>
  real-time feedback to developers is provided, supporting their work;
- **"Rapid composition of distributed simulations"**:<br>
thanks to a flexible query architecture, information from diverse simulations can be joined at runtime;
  - *Scalability*: unnecessary data are not transmitted;
  - *Efficiency*: thanks to a subscription-based approach, data retrieval can be optimized.

# An Exemplar Implementation

{{% multicol %}}
{{% col class="mt-5 col-7" %}}

- The **Monitor** is a *Web Application*;
  - Thanks to the rich ecosystem of libraries available, data visualization can be implemented effectively;
  
- The **Broker** is a *GraphQL* Server;
  - The GraphQL schema provides great flexibility in query construction;
  - It allows to retrieve exactly (and only) the data we need, using the simulator's terminology for intuitive and efficient data access;
  
- Finally, the **TDS** is implemented using *Alchemist*<small>[2]</small>;
  - Alchemist is a general purpose simulator wih a focus on pervasive, aggregate, and nature-inspired computing.

# Evaluation

{{% multicol %}}{{% col class="col-8"%}}
- An experiment from the literature is used as a case study for evaluation.
  - It implements an extended version of the *Vascular Morphogenesis Controller* algorithm in **Aggregate Computing** <small>[3]</small>.

- The algorithm begins with a *single node* and will gradually generate more according to the environmental conditions.

# Evaluation
## Real-time feedback

- The proposed prototype allows for **real-time monitoring** of data evolution across *multiple distributed simulations*;

- Data from all simulations can be *aggregated* to provide a comprehensive overview of the system being observed.

# Evaluation - Scalability
{{% multicol %}}
{{% col %}}
- A **Baseline Query** retrieves the whole state of the simulation;
  - the typical approach for monitoring distributed systems.

{{% /col %}}
{{% col %}}
- A **Specific Query** retrieves only a required subset of data;
  - the approach proposed in this work.

{{% /col %}}
{{% /multicol %}}

- The *size of the response* is checked for both queries as the number of nodes increase in the simulation.

{{< figure src="scalability.svg" width="40%">}}

- In both approaches, the response size **scales proportionally** with the node count;
- However, the **Specific Query is more efficient**, as it retrieves only the *required data*.

<small>Results reflect the aggregation of *10* simulations, each with a different seed.</small>

---

# Evaluation - Efficiency

- Without access to a subscriptions, **polling** can be used to continuously retrieve data from the simulation;

- Selecting the polling frequency becomes crucial to *balance* the trade-off between **Lost Updates** and **Useless Polling**.

- Moreover, the *speed at which the simulators handle events* significantly influences this choice.

<small>

- **Lost update**:  a missed event that occurred between two consecutive query calls;
- **Useless polling**: a query is executed without capturing new events since the last executed query.

</small>

{{< figure src="efficiency.svg">}}

<small>Results reflect the aggregation of *100* simulations, each with a different seed.</small>

# Future Work

- Focus on **refining** the presented prototype;
  - **Enhance the UI** in terms of *features* and *usability*;
  
- Apply the proposed architecture to other simulators to verify its **general applicability**;

- Investigate potential **memory issues** that may be induced by a *subscription-based approach* in *fast-paced* simulations;

- Investigate the effect of potential countermeasures, such as **throttling**, in an extremely challenging larger-scale scenario with very fast events.
